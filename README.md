# Monte-Carlo-Pi-Simulation

This is my own Monte Carlo Pi Simulation using the technique where you make a large amount of points to simulate an integral, and get the ratio of points in order to estimate pi.
It took about 6 hours to complete! This is one of my first finished pygame projects so I'm quite fond of it.

To begin, use the green circle start button, you can stop the simulation at any time by using the red stop button, or restarting it using the yellow arrow.
While the simulation is running you can speed it up to 100x by continuously pressing the speed up button until explosion-like speed. Finally, at around 10,000 points, the system
begins to lag so you can use the no lag button to stop putting points onto the circle, but the calculations can still continue.

Please enjoy one of my first finished products!
